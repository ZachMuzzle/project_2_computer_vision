# Stereo Vision Project

## Overview
* This project focuses on stereo vision of an image. Three methods to do this are done, I used **SSD** which stands for **Sum of Squared Differences**. The second method used was **SAD** which stands for **Sum of Absolute Differences**. Finally, the third method used was **NCC** which stands for **Normalized Cross Correlation**. All three of these methods are tested on images using different templates and window sizes. 

## Goal of This Project
* We want to take two images that are slightly different in what they are showing. E.G. One image might be centered, but the second my have more to the right.
* So, we take these to images and using one of the three methods, we find the disparity of the the images together.
